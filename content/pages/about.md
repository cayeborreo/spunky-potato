Hey there. I'm <mark>**Caye**</mark>, a registered pharmacist and web developer based in Manila. (View my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcborreo/))

There's lots of things I'm passionate about but you can find health tech in the forefront of them all. Our health care system has plenty of gaps and pain points tech can help solve, so I'm trying to find the bridge between those two⁠—or help build it, if it isn't there yet.

I'm also a firm believer of diversity in any movement, advocacy or team ([this podcast](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/02/625426015/the-edge-effect) explains it better than I ever could). [Women Who Code MNL](https://www.womenwhocode.com/manila) shares this belief, and I'm proud to be part of the community.

Besides health tech, public health and pharmacy-related stuff, I also love design, UI/UX, travel, beaches and snorkeling and... John Mayer 🤣

This blog will be a mix of all these and whatever I learn along the way. <mark>I write primarily to keep a snapshot of my state of mind at any given time, and secondarily to signal-boost shared advocacies to like-minded people.</mark> Maybe I could help future me (or perhaps others in same predicaments) navigate and make better decisions by documenting everything I've learned so far.

So there. Welcome to my little corner in the web. Make yourself at home ☕
