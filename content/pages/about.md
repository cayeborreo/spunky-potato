![Hey there! 🌻](/media/about/hi.jpg)

Hey there. I'm **Caye**, a registered pharmacist and web developer based in Manila. (View my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcborreo/))

There are a lot of things I'm passionate about but you can find health tech in the forefront of them all. There are so many gaps and pain points in the health care system that tech can help solve, and I'm trying to find the bridge between those two.

I'm also a firm believer of diversity in any movement, advocacy or team ([this podcast](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/02/625426015/the-edge-effect) explains it better than I ever could). [@WomenWhoCodeMNL](https://www.womenwhocode.com/manila) shares this belief, and I'm proud to be part of the community.

Besides health tech, public health and pharmacy-related stuff, I also love design, UI/UX, travel, beaches and snorkeling and... John Mayer 🤣 This blog will be a mix of all these and whatever I learn along the way.

So there. Welcome to my little corner in the web. Make yourself at home ☕
