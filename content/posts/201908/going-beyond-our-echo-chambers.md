**On May 14, a day after the Philippines' midterm elections,** Twitter Philippines released a [thread](https://twitter.com/TwitterPH/status/1128093805251403777) on the most talked about topics and senate candidates during the election season.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Candidates have also been actively using Twitter to connect with the general public on a more personal level &amp; to express their stand on issues and advocacies. Among the candidates, <a href="https://twitter.com/SamiraGutoc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@SamiraGutoc</a> emerged as the most talked about on Twitter during the election season. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eleksyon2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Eleksyon2019</a> <a href="https://t.co/PByPoO5XHq">pic.twitter.com/PByPoO5XHq</a></p>&mdash; Twitter Philippines (@TwitterPH) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterPH/status/1128244846794141697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">May 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Four out of the five Most Tweeted about candidates were from the Liberal Party's #OtsoDiretso slate, and one was from Makabayan. No day went by without a trending tweet lauding their progressive stances.

Considering they've bagged the "youth vote" and got passionate advocates campaigning for them, you'd like to believe that their names have at least trickled down to the average Filipino household.

Well, we all know how this ends.

**None of them won.** Among the five, Diokno [placed highest](https://halalanresults.abs-cbn.com/candidate/diokno-chel) at #21. Gutoc placed #25. In a race where only 12 senators are to be chosen, ranking 20+ indicates lots of legroom for the campaign's improvement (either that, or the results were heavily rigged 🤔).

Which begs the question: If these candidates had such a strong online presence in a social media platform with 10 million Filipino users, how and where, then, did it go wrong?

**With the advent of social media, _echo chambers_** has suddenly become a buzzword. _Like attracts like_ is now a core principle for algorithms, as tech giants begin to dictate your feed by showing you more things similar to those you previously interacted with—because that's where the money is. (One buying hack out there is if you want to purchase something, just Google it multiple times and wait for the related ads and discounts to pop up during your normal browsing sessions.)

So yes, imagine all the things you like forming a bubble around you, leaving no space for opposing viewpoints or things you are honestly indifferent about. This bubble effectively forms a filter around you, where everything that goes through it is mostly varied forms of things you've liked before. The algorithm won’t dare, say, put an apple or a jackfruit in a person’s mostly-citruses feed.

On a much larger scale, the _like attracts like_ principle still applies. Imagine a horde of like-minded people-bubbles gathered on one side of the spectrum, with another horde at the other.

Done imagining it? That’s basically polarization.

The two different sides birth their own chambers, and opinions wafting through their spaces normally meet with agreement and get echoed as a result of thriving in a homogenous population.

<p>The thing is: When it comes to advocacies, the people we most need to reach out to aren’t the ones on the same side of the spectrum—it’s the ones at the middling or far end of it. And reaching them is just the first obstacle.</p>

**Echo chambers are not inherently bad.** I personally live in one, and it gets really handy for when I want to see curated content. I have two Twitter accounts: the original one was created way back 2010, and the more "professional" one just last year. In my newer account, I've decided to follow all the people whose work I'm interested in: public health officials, people (especially women) in tech, academicians, and advocacy groups. My feed magically updates me with the things I care most about.

We can use echo chambers to our advantage. <mark>The problem, however, lies in thinking we can expect an attitude shift by staying in them.</mark>

**Humans are _so_ great at self-preservation.** It is our nature to survive in any environment we're placed in; we'll practically resort to any coping mechanism to protect our well-being.

So, okay. Let's say we've managed to go beyond our little spheres of influence and tried reaching out to people farther from our usual zones. We start to engage.

**The next obstacle we'll be crashing head-on is outright disagreement, even before we've made our case.**

One common cognitive coping mechanism we humans have is **<mark>confirmation bias</mark>**, where we tend to only listen to things that confirm our core belief systems. Anything that threatens or challenges those core systems, we instinctively repel and reason out of.

Horoscopes are a perfect example of the affirmation part. When they seem to be "accurate", it's because we tailor-fit whatever we've read to confirm something that we're already experiencing. In short, we reaffirm easily by making it about us.

And when something contradictory presents itself, our brain instantly says _wrong!_ to protect our core beliefs. To be fair, this isn’t always a bad thing because dealing with cognitive dissonance all the time can greatly disturb our mental health, and confirmation bias saves us from that mess.

But _too_ effectively, it also draws us away from confronting false beliefs (see: flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers) or beliefs that have gone stale, as our values change over time. This is quite unfortunate because once we overcome the initial stress of meeting with a contradictory viewpoint, productive discussions and opportunities for growth and cultivating empathy follow.

So if we're battling polarized environments and natural biases that are hard to ignore, how do we forward our advocacies and engage other people better? Here's a list of good starting points:
<br />
<br />

### 1. Get your audience's pulse. Frame your intent based on their values.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/58jHhNzUHm4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" title="YouTube: How can you change someone’s mind (TED-Ed)" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  </blockquote>
</figure>

People often forget this when engaging: **Not everyone has the same values.** Engaging a different audience with the same tone will almost always cause flame wars—_and we should expect that_, because it means everyone's confirmation biases are at work. Totally normal. What's not normal is fanning the flames by stubbornly using the same arguments and believe we're "educating" and getting some converts through this process.

Situations like this also beg the question _should this discussion be online or is it best carried out offline?_ because social media is not the best avenue for certain kinds of engagements.

Online or offline, it’s best to build solid common ground right from the beginning and invest on good rapport. Present arguments in ways that would make people care. What are they willing to listen to? What's the craziest idea they can tolerate? How will this viewpoint align to their values, and how will it eventually benefit them?
<br />
<br />

### 2. Facts are not enough. Take emotions into account.

[One of my favorite podcasts](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/18/743195213/facts-arent-enough-the-psychology-of-false-beliefs) tackled how facts are not enough to change people's minds, because the more powerful factor here is... \*drumroll\* our _emotions_. Hard facts, data visualized in charts and graphs are nice and all, but if they were not able to tell a story—if they were not able to elicit an emotion—then those numbers will fail in inspiring the audience to act.

<iframe width="560" height="150" src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/743195213/743559544" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" title="NPR: Facts Aren’t Enough: The Psychology of False Beliefs (Hidden Brain podcast)" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This podcast also explained when fear or hope becomes an effective voice. The gist of it is that **fear** works when people are "stressed out" or agitated over a certain issue, and you want to reinforce _inaction_. On the other hand, **hope** is a great motivator for _action_.

This can be seen in reality as we examine which of the two feeds various campaigns. Anti-vaxxers scare parents and prompt them to _not_ vaccinate by saying vaccines "cause autism", "contain toxic content", and overall "do more harm than good" even when scientific evidence has debunked all these; on the other hand, images of yellow ribbons and throngs of people in EDSA flashing the "L" sign became important symbols of hope during the 1986 People Power Revolution, which prompted people to act and join mobilizations on the streets.
<br />
<br />

### 3. And lastly... consider that you may be wrong.

As much as we'd like to believe we're right all the time, sometimes it might be us who have false or stale beliefs (or perhaps parts of them). If we're asking other people to re-evaluate their stances, we should be just as willing to take our own advice first.

Take everything from a logical perspective, and see if the arguments supporting the belief in question are still in line with your values. Maybe it's a washed-down stance people in your echo chamber have mindlessly parroted back since time immemorial, and there are actually chinks in the armor. It's these weak points that are most worthy of attention, so inspect them thoroughly.

In the end you might or might not have the same conviction, but that window of open-mindedness is an exercise towards a healthy view on what can be up for debate.

If there's a lesson to be learned from #Eleksyon2019, it's that echo chambers = comfort zones. They're nice and cozy, but the real campaigns plus problems that need to be talked about and their corresponding solutions are found beyond them—[preferably offline](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1218526). They'll always be there, though, when we need to recharge and regather support and affirmation from time to time.

So next time you post that strongly worded tweet you've been drafting in the hopes of swaying people, take a step back first. If you decide to release it out to the world and it gains traction, it means it hasn't reached the opposing side yet. And once it has and meets with legit non-trolling criticism, best to hear them out before crafting your arguments to avoid a non-productive discussion.

If it's another goddamn _“[sco pa tu manaa](https://www.wheninmanila.com/what-does-sco-pa-tu-manaa-mean-and-why-is-it-all-over-twitter/)”_ tweet though, skip it. ◼️
