  I’m trying out a segment called <b>In Three’s</b>. I am a sucker for memorabilia, life snippets included. And there is something so naturally easy and comfortable about lists that I find myself constantly making them.

  That said, here’s something to sum up my past two weeks.

## 1. Something old and something new—

![Keeping up with traditions](/media/20190817/cinemalaya.jpg)

My first Cinemalaya film was _Ekstra_ way back in 2013. After that, I made it a point to watch at least one film every year.

I've been keeping up the old tradition with such dedication that I even layout the whole schedule in a Google Sheet (this year [it leveled up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZiFnp-Wjc4stncpqFMQD2YXzvaWkXRkvbay-YVnmQl4/edit#gid=1683848651), because I can make a mean query now with nested formulas 😎).

I watched a mix of films, from the new roster and those from previous festivals. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/Q3Z8FnH_Agg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward</a></i> was a clear favorite from the first few seconds because it was in the hospital setting, and triaging problems were shown in the beginning 🤣 It was also heartwarming towards the end. I watched it with Jow, Alexa, Raissa and Pia, and then we had dinner and beer by the bay afterwards.

Jow and I watched <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ubCZXV_X74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signal Rock</a></i> after and I finally get why it's the PH's Oscar bet during its year (though some vfx were sorta...whut). The rest of the films, I watched alone. _[Iska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TiP-ISkXvc)_ was painstakingly real and heartbreaking in the end, and Shorts A had three gems I liked.

If there was a theater experience favorite from this year, it was from when I watched _[Hintayan ng Langit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps9fD08YBmg)_. Midway through the film, **everyone in the theater was collectively quiet-sobbing 🤣** There was some satisfaction there because I'm usually the only one who cries at the littlest things in movies, but since everyone's doing so the usual self-consciousness I feel was stripped away.

## 2. Something borrowed—

The nice thing about being independent is you're on your own. The not-so-nice thing about being independent is you're also on your own when you catch fever and get sick.

So I skipped work. And the first thing I wanted on that cold, rainy morning was hot broth, so I scavenged our fridge and found out I had some frozen chicken lying around. I decided I'm sick enough to deserve hot broth, but well enough to buy vegetables. The wet market's just a five-minute walk, anyway.

Sometimes it amazes me how far my Php 30 can go. (Hint: Two thumb-sized gingers, two sayotes, and a bundle of malunggay leaves)

I borrowed my mom's recipe.

## 3. Something (that made her feel) blue—

There are certain people whose humor and train of thought you just get. Reader, I hope that when you meet them, you make the genuine effort to keep them. Let's not have the same regrets.

It goes the same for books. Just by saying it's penned by my favorite show's creator is a sellout for me—I'm not letting a book I am highly likely to be absorbed with just slip by me.

![Goddamn, this book.](/media/20190817/new-book.jpg)

[It was everything I hoped for, and more](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2930458358?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1). RBW was so consistently weird: think Anti-Doors, goat-slaughtering during weddings, staying in a train car for sixty years. _That_ kind of weird; the kind that comes up with imaginative, out-of-this-world situations. But in between it also had some very real parts. No matter how ridiculous the setting was, the characters still felt very human, and their experiences were genuine and fleshed out.

It's so good.

There are certain attacks, too. Some lines you recognize from past conversations, some lines you realize you said yourself. I think anyone can find something that resonates with them.

It's been a while since I've read a book I liked so much that I highlighted some parts. And I have no idea what salted circus cashews taste like, but I definitely want a can for myself.

    <p>“—and a sixpence in her shoe.”</p>

<footer>[This is] a traditional rhyme that details what a bride should wear at her wedding for good luck. The old item provided protection for the baby to come. The item borrowed from another happy bride provided good luck. The colour blue was a sign of fidelity. The sixpence—a silver British coin—was a symbol of prosperity or acted as a ward against evil done by frustrated suitors. —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_old" alt="Wikipedia" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></footer>
