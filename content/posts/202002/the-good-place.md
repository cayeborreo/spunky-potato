<figcaption>The first words you see in the afterlife</figcaption>—

January 20th was a special day. It witnessed the series finale of a TV show that's unlike any of the shows before it: A sitcom with funny, relatable characters in a fantasy afterlife setting.

_"That doesn't make them special enough,"_ you say. And I hear you. Because what truly sets this show apart is that between the laughable moments and absurd "Good Place" nuances (like the insistent censoring of curse words into "fork" and "shirt"), this show manages to throw around philosophy and ethics concepts throughout its storyline like it's no big deal.

But it was. It still is. At least for me, and probably other viewers who now have refreshed views on what it takes to live well.

_The Good Place_ was built on a simple premise: Eleanor, a human with a horrible attitude during her time on Earth, dies and wakes up in "the Good Place". Except she's taken some other Eleanor's place and doesn't actually belong there, while a series of malfunctions that occur in the neighborhood emphasizes this mistake.

Eleanor eventually confides to her "soulmate", a moral philosophy and ethics professor named Chidi, about her real identity and convinces him to teach her about morality and ethics so she could eventually earn her slot in the Good Place. The series also follows amateur DJ Jason Mendoza, another "mistake" who's posing to be Jianyu the silent monk, and Tahani Al-Jamil, a British socialite and philanthropist who's almost perfect, except she _loves_ to name-drop ("My only real goal was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball. (_Pause._) Which I did. (_Another pause._) Couple of times, actually.").
