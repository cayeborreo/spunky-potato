**For the first few glances, clean slates freak me out.** They just look so sparkling clean, as if it’d be a sin to even try smudging the surface.

I feel the same about life in general. It’s why I have a lot of pretty notebooks at home left unused. And if we’re going to the extremes, the worst example of how this attitude manifested was after I graduated from college. I was this bright-eyed idealist ready to change the world, but with no idea how. What was I ought to do after graduation, anyway? There were a bazillion choices to choose from, which at the time I thought was actually a good thing.

But now I’ve resigned to the fact that <mark>the more choices I have, the more paralyzed (and unhappier) I tend to be</mark>. And a clean slate is exactly that: It’s a picture of a thousand choices I have yet to make.

I said it freaks me out for the first few glances. After switching between hesitation, enthusiasm, doubts, and mini-breakdowns in between, I will eventually channel this not-giving-a-fuck state and dive headfirst to finally give that clean canvas the splatters and smudges it deserves.

So here I am smudging this new blog of mine with my first post, and I’m planning to tackle every single clean area I see here and dump it with words as I go along.

Blogging used to be a hobby, something my teenage self kept doing because it was “cool”. But it was fun to see that as the years pass by my reasons have also changed. Right now, it’s primarily to keep a snapshot of who I am and what kind of mindset I have today, plus learnings I gather along the way.

I started to blog in 2010, end of second year high school. I actually dug up my very first post, and here it is:

I was so immature that my 2013 self did not resist editing that first post 🤦‍♀️

But we all start somewhere, I guess. I suddenly remembered a conversation: As I was setting up this blog, Kim, my manager at work (who’s also a pharmacist) gave me some helpful suggestions. And at the end of it she said something to the effect of “If only I were a writer [I’d have set up a blog, too].” And honestly, I think she got it backwards.

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t blog *because* I’m a writer. But I think blogging consistently has made me one.</p>

Man, looking back I owe blogging a lot. This hobby in some way has led me to my job right now as a web developer, because maintaining a blog pushed me to learn how to code. Like I said, it was deemed “cool” back then—especially if you made your own themes. I was always aiming for Skin of the Day bragging rights (there was this platform, [blogskins.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150426125229/blogskins.com/me/ohfudge1), where a community of bloggers submit their themes).

I shelved coding when I was in college, and during that period JavaScript had a really major glow-up. I wasn’t even proficient with the vanilla kind, and now that I’ve went back to it there were all sorts of frameworks to choose from. Life became easier than hard-coding them all, but it was also harder in that I had to learn new patterns and principles. It was a shock, but an exciting one.

It’s so funny how something that started out so trivial rippled into this. I can’t believe that no matter how naive she was, my 2010 self somehow propelled me into this kind of career 🤣

Okay, story time’s over. I blabbed more than I initially intended (again) lmao. It’s a Saturday, and I ought to go home to my province in a few because one of my aunts is celebrating her 50th. It’s a fancy dinner with a program 😅

Anyway, this slate won’t remain clean-ish for long. I’m thinking of all the things I can write about: career, public health, tech, pharma, travel, design, and how they all connect + some of the more personal shenanigans every now and then. I’m excited.

Hope you all have a nice weekend 🎉
