2019 has me doing all sorts of crazy things. Sometimes I wonder if something got plugged in my core that's been powering all these decisions lately, including the one that made me book this flight months ago.

I didn't know a thing about Bohol, which made it the ideal destination when the airfares went on sale. I just grabbed the chance and decided, well, here goes my first solo trip.

<figcaption>It's just... hills everywhere?</figcaption>

It was a Friday when I landed. Since I was two hours earlier than the expected 9am pick-up time for the day tour, first order of business after landing was breakfast at [Shaka](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/Restaurant_Review-g1036817-d12452614-Reviews-Shaka_Bohol-Panglao_Island_Bohol_Province_Visayas.html) near Alona Beach, Panglao. They boast a healthy menu, so I tried their bestseller Bom Dia fruit bowl. For one person the serving was too much, but it was tasty and filling anyway (and I really liked their homemade granola).

Afterwards, the Countryside Tour commenced 🌄

No shortage of nature here in mainland Bohol. And Bohol's pretty known for its tarsiers, so of course we _had_ to visit the conservatory area. They're about the size of my fist! They're nocturnal, though, hence the sleeping primate picture. Everyone kept shushing us while on the trail hahaha

We had a buffet lunch, river-cruise style, in Loboc. My lunchmates were a family from Rizal vacationing around Cebu and Bohol for the week, and we mostly just critiqued the food being served 😂 The cruise once stopped by a stationed raft along the river and we got to watch a group of performers sing while dancing the _tinikling_. We also had a guitarist-singer onboard, singing songs from Mama Stella's times (the sassy grandma pictured above).

The rest of the tour were structures and whatnot. We concluded around 5pm, and after dropping off some people in Tagbilaran City we went back to Panglao Island. I was dropped off at Alona Beach so I had to _habal_ to the Airbnb place I booked (~15mins), which I didn't mind because it was fun going around Panglao for a bit. I realized you could circle the whole of the island in less than half a day.

![Habal nation](/media/2019-07-28/habal-nation.gif)

**If there was anything to complain about, it was the lack of transportation options.** Going around Panglao was either through tricycle (Php150-300 per special trip) or _habal_/motorbike (Php50-100 per special trip), so I had to have my itinerary planned out at the start of the day to ensure I have everything I need while I'm out and about. Don't even get me started on the airport transfer—freaking Php300 for a mere two-mile trip? Ugh. Clueless tourists are being milked here.

I wasn't ready to let that slide by this point, but day one didn't end so bad as my Airbnb host welcomed we warmly. Their private guesthouse was so relaxing and tranquil and hotel-like that I could've opted for a staycation and I wouldn't have minded. They also have a black Labrador named Bomber who I got to play with for a bit, so... fine. I was ready to forgive the day's annoyances after that.

Day two's island-hopping adventure was to be the highlight of my trip, though.

I cried myself to sleep after watching _Grave of the Fireflies_ (yes, I brought a flash drive with me, and my room had a flat-screen TV so why not), which meant I also forgot to set the alarm for the next day. Luckily, I woke up at 5am and was just in time for the 6am meetup along Alona Beach.

We were a group of 16 in that boat. It took us probably an hour or so before we reached Balicasag Island, and after that we had to form groups of four to six people to go to the designated snorkeling sites.

I went with these two ladies and their German friend, who I would soon learn and figure out to be a group of academics/biologists. Sharon and Hopie were from Mindanao State U, and Bart was once their professor while they were pursuing their postgrad studies in Germany. **They were so cool.** I couldn't have imagined better companions for an island-hopping adventure, honestly 🤣 They were nerding out over the various sea creatures we saw, and it was like having free tour guides all along.

![Goddamn those depths.](/media/2019-07-28/damn-thats-deep.gif)

I submerged my camera and took videos randomly while we were boating towards the snorkeling sites. When I saw this particular footage, I was amazed and scared at the same time. Just imagine how deep that part is right there! Goddamn.

<figcaption>Look at all those fishes! 🐠</figcaption>

And then we went snorkeling. **It was so beautiful, I wanted to cry.** I've been to several snorkeling sites before, including El Nido in Palawan and Apo Island in Negros Oriental, but goddamn. No one held a candle against Balicasag's beauty. I've never seen marine life this up close, and the fishes were just _swarming_. I got to see them in schools. 🐠

<figcaption>Oh my fish 🐠</figcaption>

After snorkeling, we headed towards Virgin Island. There was a sandbar, so we took our time exploring the sea creatures that lived there. One conversation went like this:

<blockquote>
<b>Them:</b> (points at a creature that does not look like a jellyfish) Look, a jellyfish!<br />
<b>Me:</b> (dumb but amazed) Awww, there are many of them!<br />
<b>Them:</b> They're stingless.<br />
<b>Me:</b> 🤯<br />
</blockquote>

<figcaption>Look at it go 🥺</figcaption>

Honestly, this went on for every sea creature we saw. I was the constantly amazed student that day, and I'm not complaining.

<figcaption>Apparently, they call this the chocolate chip starfish. And with good reason. 🍪⭐</figcaption>

After exploring the sandbar, we all rendezvoused by the boat and went to head back to Panglao. It was around 2pm by the time the tour wrapped up.

The biologists were staying in Tagbilaran, so we said our goodbyes as they proceeded to their 30-min travel time. Afterwards, I had lunch near Alona Beach, with Bohol Bee Farm's guyabano ice cream as dessert. It was yummy, being coconut cream-based and all.

The rest of the trip was me lounging by the house, buying pasalubong, playing with Bomber, sleeping, then packing for my Sunday afternoon flight. It was just my luck that it only started to rain on Saturday afternoon, right after all my itineraries were done with.

Looking back, there was nothing that ~profound~ on going on a solo trip. <mark>I had no epic realizations or anything, but I did like having to travel on my own terms, at my own time and at my own pace.</mark> The only downside was I had to exert myself to make friends; but then again, that's a muscle I need to exercise every now and then 😅

My companions were always slightly surprised that I came alone, which I understood because this used to be a foreign concept to me, too, until just recently. But I think that if you're privileged enough to do so, you owe it to yourself to go travel on your own at least once in your life. It sort of gave me this feeling that I can be in command of anything, and I liked it and how it lingered long after my trip's over 😊

I'm glad I spent this first in Bohol. It felt like time suspended while I was there, and at the same time the weekend flew by so fast 😅

I'm sure this isn't the last time I'll see Panglao. So I guess... until then ❤️
